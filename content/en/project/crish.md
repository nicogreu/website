I believe that in the mind of most people, a fiction work that is purposely "educational" inevitably comes with an uninteresting - and probably childish - story. This rather strong association makes sense when we look at what exists. But I don't think it **has** to be that way.


### The start of the journey

A few years ago, convinced that educationalÂ fiction was not incompatible with a good story, I decided to have a go at proving my point. I read and watched many pieces of script writing advice and started to imagine a story (in comic form) where I could explain the reasoning behind statistical tests in an intuitive and interesting way. I thumbnailed it, liked the result, and decided to work seriously in my drawing skills.


### It's live!

Fast forward several years later and here we are. The first part of the comic {{< rawhtml >}} <span class="font-crish italic text-2xl"> crish </span> {{< /rawhtml >}} is available for free [here](https://crish.fr) under the pen names {{< rawhtml >}} <span class="font-crish"> greu & duduq</span>{{< /rawhtml >}} and a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/") license. However, since I want to decide the if, when and how of an eventual paper version, the electronic version - which has a nicer resolution - is only available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license. But in the end, if your plan is not to sell the comic, I'm probably happy with whatever you use it for.

### A bit of Statistics and some Research Methods tips
I wanted {{< rawhtml >}} <span class="font-crish italic text-2xl"> crish </span> {{< /rawhtml >}} to be first and foremost a fun and interesting story to read, but I obviously also wanted it to have educative value. I made the protagonists use and explain a couple of statistical tests within the story. A more in depth explanation of statistical tests is given at the end, and Research Methods tips are given along the way.



I think the story is funny, but my humor may not be everyone's taste, so maybe you'll disagree. I don't know if I succeeded in my attempt, but I hope the result is at least interesting. I may add more to this post later, but for now I just hope you have a fun read.
