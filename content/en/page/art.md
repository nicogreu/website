<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-4">Art & Effort</h3>

I think I’ve always had a knack for doing math or philosophy. This is much less true for art, where I’ve had to work very hard to get from drawing like <a href="#" onclick="openImageModal(); return false;">this</a> in my early 30s to being able to create what you can see [here](https://krita-artists.org/u/nicogreu/activity/portfolio) or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/duduqdrawstuff/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

This reflects how I work. I always put a lot of effort in what I do. And I always make sure the things I produce are visually and artistically compelling.<br><br>
