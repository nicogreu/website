<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-4">Research in Analytic Philosophy</h3>
In philosophy, I am primarily interested in <strong>understanding how we can learn from data</strong>, and in exploring whether <em>informal statistical reasoning</em> can shed light on key questions in epistemology, decision theory and the philosophy of science.<br><br>

My secondary research interests include contributions to the niche branch of the **philosophy of comics** and to the interdisciplinary field of **experimental philosophy**.<br><br>

The research outputs resulting from my ongoing transition into these philosophical investigations are presented below.<br><br>

For a full list of my publications, please check [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XDIgmMMAAAAJ) or have a look at my <a href="/en/cv">CV</a>.<br><br>
