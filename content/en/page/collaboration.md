My scientific background makes me particularly interested in **collaborating** with other philosophers on **experimental philosophy projects**.<br><br>

 
I have assisted many social science students and researchers in refining experimental designs similar to those typically used in experimental philosophy. Combined with my strong research methods expertise, this experience has given me a particularly **sharp eye for good designs**.<br><br>

 
If you are planning an experimental philosophy project, I would love to be involved.
