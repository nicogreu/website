<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-4">The Project <span class="font-crish italic text-xl">crish</span></h3>

I have a dream that one day a blockbuster movie will invest a large portion of its budget in truly thoughtful educational content.<br><br>

 
Until that happens, my comic <a href="https://crish.fr/en" class="underline" target="_blank"><span class="font-crish italic text-lg">crish</span></a> --- a semi-fantastic story filled with absurd humor and brief **insights about statistics and the research world** --- is my humble attempt to show that entertaining stories can also convey deep philosophical and educational ideas.<br><br>

 
The story of <span class="font-crish italic text-lg">crish</span> is ongoing, and in the next chapters, I plan to weave in some of the results of my current research.
<br><br>

The project has been supported by two grants from the research network [GDR EcoStat](https://sites.google.com/site/gdrecostat/) and the <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/">Université Grenoble Alpes</a>.
